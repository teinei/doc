# Why are you appliying for Financial Aid?

> I was born and live in Shenyang City, China. I got about 2000 CNY per month, transportation takes me 300, the most cheap meal is 15 and 3 meals together per month will be 1350. I also need to pay for the house, electric gas water... we need to pay for water in China... the small amount  of income is not even enough for each month. What to do? You are right, beg money from parents. After some humiliation and complain I can get some. Without dignity. I live in a city has snowy and cold winter, extra money to keep warm too. It is dreadful even to write these situations down. Life is difficult right? But I need to move on. But I still keep studying every day, I want to change my life. I want to live with dignity. I want a job with higher income. But I can not afford to pay the fee. That's why I ask for financial aid. That's why I am applying for a scholarship.

> I always want to become a c programmer, because c has a lot of chance to interact with hardware. C is the first programming language I met in college.My interest to  programming start long time ago, since college, but until now, I find Coursera and start to find ways to learn.

In course 3 I can learn about pointers, from basic swap to const to pointer arithmetic, I will also learn some memory check tools. I will learn arrays which is basicly pointers, strings and recursion. In course 4 interacting with the system and managing memory, I am going to learn some more complex topic like fgetc fgets, file open and read, dynamic memory allocation, finally a pocker project. In the course Linux Server Management and Security, I can learn more about linux. I want to become a Linux C programmer, with C and Linux I have learned, with some windows server skills to enhance, this will help me to achieve my career goals.

## >> for CPA
> I have applied for CICPA exam and Financial Accounting, Managerial Accounting, Corporate Finance, Taxation and other related courses are made up the CPA exam. I try my best to find the courses online, the courses in Chinese are boring and tedious, some of them are even paid, but totally not worth the price. Finally I found Coursera and the business courses. They are easy to understand, relax and happy. The professor is no longer over-enthusiastic like in North Korea news or like a propaganda. English has been my first language to learn for long time, and I am prepared to use it to prepare the CPA exam. My major at collage is Financial Management and I want to have a closure of my four years. AICPA are better choice but I do not have budget to apply. So get knowledge in English and take the CICPA exam. It will work! Thank you Coursera Guys and Ladies. Be a crossover specialist. That’s my career goal.

There is even some nice course in other languages like Spanish called Programando con Java para aplicaciones Android by Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico.

## >> for korean

>  A language is the key to a particular culture. And there is so much fun within the process of learning a new language. I can explore the splendid culture of these people, I can learned the way they live and think, I can find a different way to see things, a different point of view. Korean is an advanced country in economy, it’s culture is intresting and sophisticated, the science and technology is higly developed, a large amount of global companies are from this land, for instance samsung electronics, lg electronics, sk communications, hyundai motors, kia motors, naver.com, and so on. Korean people are downplayed at the same time ardour in life and work, hardworking diligent courageous brave and industrious. In the future, north korea will open its gate and welcome people from all around the world. I hope I can be one of those people that explore the beautiful land. There can be miracles, I hope I am the one that make it happens. Korean language will help me to achieve my career goals.
