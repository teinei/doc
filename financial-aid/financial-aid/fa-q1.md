## Question 1 Why are you appliying for Financial Aid?

> Dear Coursera Financial Aid Administrator
> 
> Thank you for the offer of financial aid for attending Coursera's Course.
> I am from China, a sovereign state with the 2nd largest GDP just a little less than USA, even the GDP per capital is more than 8000 USD now, but my income is just a half of GDP per capital divided by ten, that is less than 400 USD per month.
> 
> I am from a humble family and my parents are peasants in a small village near Shenyang(mukden) city. I moved to the city and stay since left college.
> The wages of me is just enough to cover my life expense, and I have to make mortgage payments every month. 
> Even though I can speak and use English properly but I still make very little money, that is one of the reason I want to learn more skills from Coursera online courses.
> 50 dollars is not a big number but that's almost the traffic fee I pay for each month and one week's food expense. Rich city, poor me. 
> 
> But I want to make a difference, I want to have a try. Everyone has need the chance and platform to learn and improve themselves, including the low income citizens from third world. 
> That's why I am applying for financial aid/scholarship.
